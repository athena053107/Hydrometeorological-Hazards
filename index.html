							<h2>Tropical Cyclones</h2>
							<p>Tropical cyclones, also known as typhoons or hurricanes, are among the most destructive weather phenomena. 
<br> 
They are intense circular storms that originate over warm tropical oceans and have maximum sustained wind speeds exceeding 119 km per hour and heavy rains.
<br>
<br>
Tropical cyclones are referred to by different names depending on where they originate in the world.
<br>
• Hurricanes occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern north Pacific Ocean.
<br>
• Typhoons occur in the western Pacific Ocean.
<br>
• Tropical cyclones occur in the south Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.

							<h2>Signs of Impending Typhoon</h2>
							<p>Every typhoon is different and there are many factors that contribute to its development. However, the following is a general sequence of events that could occur during the development of a Category 2 typhoon (wind speed 96-110 mph) approaching a coastal area: 
<br>
• 96 hours before landfall – At first, there are no apparent signs of a storm. The barometer is steady, winds are light and variable, and fair-weather cumulus clouds appear.
<br>
• 72 hours before landfall – Little has changed except that the swell on the ocean surface has increased to about 6 feet and the waves come in every 9 seconds.
<br>
• 48 hours before landfall – The sky is now clear of clouds, the barometer is steady, and the wind is almost calm. The swell is now about 9 feet and coming in every 8 seconds.
<br>
• 36 hours before landfall– The first signs of the storm appear. The barometer is falling slightly, the wind is around 11 mph, and the ocean swell is about 13 feet and coming in 7 seconds apart. On the horizon, a large mass of white cirrus clouds appear. A hurricane watch is issued, and the areas with long evacuation times are give the order to begin.
<br>
• 30 hours before landfall– The sky is covered by a high overcast. The barometer is falling at 0.1 millibar per hour, winds pick up to about 23 mph. The ocean swell, coming in 5 seconds apart, is beginning to be obscured by wind-driven waves, and small whitecaps begin to appear on the ocean surface.
<br>
• 24 hours before landfall– Small low clouds appear overhead. The barometer is falling by 0.2 millibars per hour, the wind picks up to 34 mph. The wind driven waves are covered in whitecaps, and streaks of foam begin to ride over the surface. Evacuation should be completed, and final preparations should be made on this time.
<br>
• 18 hours before landfall– The low clouds are thicker and bring driving rain squalls with gusty winds. The barometer is steadily falling at half a millibar per hour and the winds are whistling by at 46 mph. It is hard to stand against the wind.
<br>
• 12 hours before landfall– The rain squalls are more frequent and the winds don not diminish after they depart. The cloud ceiling is getting lower, and the barometer is falling at 1 millibar per hour. The wind is howling at hurricane force at 74 mph. The sea advances with every storm wave that crashes ashore, and foam patches.
<br>
• 6 hours before landfall– The rain is constant and the 92 mph wind drives it horizontally. The barometer is falling 1.5 millibar per hour, and the storm surge has advanced above the high tide mark. The sea surface a whitish mass of spray. It is impossible to stand upright outside without bracing yourself.
<br>
• 1 hour before landfall– The rain becomes heavier. Low areas inland become flooded. The winds are at 104 mph, and the barometer is falling at 2 millibar per hour. The sea is white with foam and streaks. The storm surge has covered coastal roads and 16 foot waves crash into buildings near the shore.
<br>
• Landfall – The eye of the storm: Just as the storm reaches its peak, the winds begin to slacken, and the sky starts to brighten. The rain ends abruptly, and the clouds break and blue sky is seen. The barometer continues falling at 3 millibar per hour and the storm surge reaches the furthest inland. The winds fall to near calm, but the air is uncomfortably warm and humid. Huge walls of clo9ud appear on every side, brilliant white in the sunlight. At this point, the barometer stops falling and in a moment begins to rise, soon as fast as it fell. The winds begin to pick up slightly and the clouds on the far side of the eye wall loom overhead.

                <h2>Thunderstorms</h2>
                <p>Thunderstorms are weather conditions characterized by heavy rain, wind, lightning, thunder, and sometimes hail or tornadoes. They form when there is sufficient moisture and rapidly rising warm air, leading to cloud formation and darkening skies.</p>

							<h2>Tools Used for Monitoring Hydrometeorological Hazards</h2>
							<p>Monitoring hydrometeorological hazards involves using various sophisticated tools and technologies such as weather satellites, which provide real-time atmospheric data; radar systems for detecting precipitation and severe weather; automated weather stations (AWS) that measure local weather conditions; buoys and ocean monitoring systems for tracking oceanographic data; remote sensing technologies like LIDAR and SAR for environmental monitoring; numerical weather prediction (NWP) models for forecasting weather; hydrological models to simulate the water cycle and predict floods; and integrated early warning systems that combine data from multiple sources to provide timely alerts to the public and authorities.</p>
